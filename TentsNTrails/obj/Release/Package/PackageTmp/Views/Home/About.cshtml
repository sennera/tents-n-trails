<h2 style="">The Vision for Tents n Trails</h2>
<p style="text-wrap:normal">For outdoor enthusiasts who want to find better camping and hiking locations, the Tents n Trails web application is a camping/hiking directory and social networking hybrid that will serve as a single repository of camping and hiking areas that are reviewed and rated by other outdoor enthusiasts. The system will allow users to search for outdoor camping and hiking locations based on a variety of criteria (name, overall user ranking, location, etc.), review and rate the sites that they have visited, share pictures and videos they took at the location, and bookmark outdoor sites that they really enjoyed or would like to go to in the future. Administrators will be able to moderate the community effectively through banning users that violate the terms of service agreement and remove reviews and media items that have been marked for inappropriate or spam content. Unlike most outdoors-based websites that only have top-ten lists, our product will serve as a single searchable, democratized location where people can find out where the best outdoor locations are and interact or connect with other outdoor lovers.</p>
